                    As a software development engineer intern on the Free Search Traffic team, I was responsible for building a database synchronization tool that served as a component for a new project being rolled out.  I translated the requirements into a design, presented it to the team for review, and iterated until it recieved approval.  Once the design was approved, I leveraged existing libraries and wrote new Java classes to implement the design.

                    As a teaching assistant for the class CS 4102 - Analysis of Algorithms, my responsibilities were twofold.  During office hours I would meet with students to field their questions about the material and help them on homework problems.  After homeworks were submitted the other TA and I were responsible for creating the rubrics and completing the grading.

                    As an intern at Dun & Bradstreet I worked on the team in charge of the Intelligence Engine, a tool for automating the process of associating customer queries with the corresponding company entry in the database.  I wrote SQL queries, created PL/SQL packages, and used excel spreadsheets to analyze data generated by the engine and identify areas where its improvment could be optimized.  I also created a Java utility that could produce Excel spreadsheets based on user-provided SQL queries.

                            The delivery robot uses reflective sensors to follow a line.  Orders (which consist of a warehouse to go to get a particular "item" and a location to take that item), could be entered into a website that passed them to a database, and the robot would then read the orders from the database using the Adafruit CC3000 wifi sheild.  Upon completing an order, it would update the database with the time and distance the robot travelled.  It also decremented the stock of that particular item in the database.

                            Tasked with teaching a subject on the Virginia SOL to a class of seventh grade students, my group used an Arduino hooked up to an ultrasonic distance sensor and a buzzer to create a helmet that informed the wearer of how close they were to a wall by increasing the rate of the beeps being emitted.  The students were able to get a taste of how echolocation works by attempting to navigate an obstacle course while blindfolded and wearing the helmet.

                        <p>
                            This project focused around an app idea to eliminate the need to stand in line to use the port-a-johns at tailgates, amusement parks, or concerts by keeping track of a virtual queue, and then notifying you when it was almost their turn to use the bathroom.  The user receives a random code, and this code becomes the only working code for the lock on the bathroom door during that person’s allocated time.  If the code isn't entered within 30 seconds, your turn is skipped and the next person’s code becomes active.  The prototype was built with a large Styrofoam door attached to some PVC pipe to make a bathroom and a Propeller microcontroller controlling the system.  Servo motors served as the locks for the door, a screen displayed the next several people in the queue, and a remote was used to enter the code.
